Hello!
This is my super-wait module for millisecond precission wait, it can even go up to microsecond!
You can use it like this
```lua
local swait = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SebExMachina/ROBLOX-scripts-ig/main/general/swait/main.lua"))();
```

it can be called like this(if swait is the variable for the module)
```lua
swait(1)
```
this uses milliseconds btw so to wait seconds u have to do 1000 for 1 second, etc
